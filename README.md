## 3. Designing for Security
### 3.1. Apply General Principles for Secure Design
* Security in the Design Phase
  * ~50% of software security issues are due to design flaws
  * The design phase refers to functions typically performed by a software architect (strategic design of the entire system)
  * Integrate security into every phase of your development process
* Security by Obscurity vs. Security by Design
  * [Open-source and the ‚Äúsecurity through obscurity‚Äù fallacy](https://www.efrontlearning.com/blog/2012/04/open-source-and-the-security-through-obscurity-fallacy.html) - efrontlearning.com
  * National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) specifically recommends against using closed source as a way to secure the software (i.e. ‚Äúsecurity through obscurity‚Äù)
  * Hiding source code is a bad way to assume you‚Äôll achieve security, because even a powerful and highly proprietary company can‚Äôt guarantee that source code won‚Äôt leak out.
* OWASP Security Design Principles ‚≠ê
  * [Secure Design Principles](https://github.com/OWASP/DevGuide/blob/master/02-Design/01-Principles%20of%20Security%20Engineering.md) - OWASP
    - Minimize attack surface area [learn more](https://www.okta.com/identity-101/what-is-an-attack-surface/)
    - Establish secure defaults
    - Least privilege
    - Defense in depth (aka layered defense)
    - Fail securely
    - Don't trust services
    - Separation of duties (aka separation of privilege)
    - Avoid Security by Obscurity
    - Economy of Mechanism (Keep It Simple, Stupid "KISS")
    - Fix security issues correctly
* Software Design Patterns
  * In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. [learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern) 
* Security Patterns
* Modular Design
  * [Separation of Concerns (SoC)](https://deviq.com/principles/separation-of-concerns) - deviq.com
* Benefits of Modular Design
  * Small manageable tasks; Reduce errors; Resuse; Maintainability
  * With a modular design, the parts do not always add up to the whole. Even though each module is essentially secure, the system as a whole may not be secure due to the complexity of interactions between modules. 
* The Balance Between Defense in Depth and Simplicity
  * KISS (‚ÄúKeep It Simple Security‚Äú)  
  * The last layer of defense for your deployment should be the ability to respond quickly.

    * Use an authentication mechanism that cannot be bypassed or tampered with.
    * Authorize after you authenticate.
    * Strictly separate data and control instructions, and never process control instructions received from untrusted sources.
    * Define an approach that ensures that all data are explicitly validated.
    * Use cryptography correctly.
    * Identify sensitive data and how they should be handled.
    * Always consider the users.
    * Understand how integrating external components changes your attack surface.
    * Be flexible when considering future changes to objects and actors.

## 6. Testing Software Security
### 6.1. Perform Security Testing
* The Role of Testing
  * Test early and test often.
  * View software design and implementation from an attacker's perspective.
  * Think of threat modeling as a form of testing (Testing the design). 
  * Mindsets; penetrate and patch, penetrate and improve, building security in
* Phases of Software Testin
  * [OWASP Web Security Testing Guide](https://github.com/OWASP/wstg) 
* Development Testing
  * Separation of duties (SoD; also known as Segregation of Duties) is the concept of having more than one person required to complete a task. 
  * **Dynamic analysis** is the testing and evaluation of an application during runtime. **Static analysis** is the testing and evaluation of an application by examining the code without executing the application.

  * Security Analysis | A detailed process to ensure that software operates at a level of security consistent with the potential harm that could result from the loss, inaccuracy, alteration, unavailability, or misuse of the data and resources that it uses, controls, and protects.
  * Looking at your code from a different perspective will find problems or ask questions that you haven't considered. 
* Code Review Strategies
  * Formal
    * Fagan Inspection |  A formal analysis process that includes a series of structured activities involving multiple participants and phases‚Äîsuch as planning, inspection, rework, and verification. The objective is to reveal defects in programming code.
