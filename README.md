## Testing Software Security
### Perform Security Testing
* The Role of Testing
  * Test early and test often.
  * View software design and implementation from an attacker's perspective.
  * Think of threat modeling as a form of testing (Testing the design). 
* Phases of Software Testin
  * [OWASP Web Security Testing Guide](https://github.com/OWASP/wstg) 
* Development Testing
  * Separation of duties (SoD; also known as Segregation of Duties) is the concept of having more than one person required to complete a task. 
  * **Dynamic analysis** is the testing and evaluation of an application during runtime. **Static analysis** is the testing and evaluation of an application by examining the code without executing the application. [Learn more](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/inspector-user-guide-windows/top/getting-started/dynamic-analysis-vs-static-analysis.html)
* Unit Testing
  * Input Validation; Output Encoding; Session Management (A&A); Encryption; Error Handling; Logging 
* Integration Testing
  * White box testing (Source Code); Gray box testing; Black box testing 
* Documentation and Deliverables for Testing
  * Input: Business requirements; SRS; Threat Models; Data flow Diagram
  * Output: Vulnerability Reports; Quality Assurance Reports
* Manual Inspection and Code Review
  * Security Analysis | A detailed process to ensure that software operates at a level of security consistent with the potential harm that could result from the loss, inaccuracy, alteration, unavailability, or misuse of the data and resources that it uses, controls, and protects.
  * Looking at your code from a different perspective will find problems or ask questions that you haven't considered. 
* Code Review Strategies
  * Formal
    * Fagan Inspection |  A formal analysis process that includes a series of structured activities involving multiple participants and phasesâ€”such as planning, inspection, rework, and verification. The objective is to reveal defects in programming code.
  * Informal
    * Over the wall (aks Pass Around)
    * Over the shoulder
    * Pair Programming  
* Guidelines for Security Testing
  * Performing Manual Inspection and Review
    - Web Server e.g., dotnet new web
    - IP Address
    - Query String (Whitelist, Length, Data type)
    - Authentication e.g., Authorize, AllowAnonymous
    - Directory browsing
